# Etch-a-Sketch JavaScript Project

This is a simple browser-based Etch-a-Sketch application created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum. Draw and sketch with your mouse on a grid, control resolution with grid size, and clear to start a new sketch.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Adjust the grid size to set resolution.
3. Hover to draw, click "Clear" to start anew.

Thank you to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for providing the inspiration and guidance for this project!

Happy sketching! ðŸŽ¨
